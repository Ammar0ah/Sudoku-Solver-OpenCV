Description:
Solves Sudoku puzzles.
First try to solve by filling in the cells with only one possibility.
If it cannot go any further, use a backtracking DFS (depth-first search)
algorithm to try the possible solutions. As soon as a solution is found,
it terminates the algorithm and prints it out.
The algorithm assumes that empty cells are denoted with a 0.
